            <h3>"Honestly, that Mr. Cat guy freaks me out. I went to his shop the other day to demand payment for setting up business in my realm — but somehow, I walked out having traded 51% of my soul for his '7 Deadly Sins' package. Now he basically owns me. And get this — he's asking for an absurd number of mortal souls just to give me 2% of my own soul back. What a jerk."</h3>
